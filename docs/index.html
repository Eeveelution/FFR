                    <p>
                        FFR (Furball Fluffy RISC) is a Architecture designed my Furball, 
                        This is mainly for 
                        
                        <b style="color: coral">educational purposes</b>
                        
                        and to explore FPGA development.
                        FPGAs seem to be the best route for me as a Software Developer to get into hardware,
                        I've tried Arduino and things like that but I never really had a compelling
                        project I wanted to do on those. and a FPGA is literally a programmable chip,
                        which makes it perfect for 
                        
                        <b style="color: coral">custom CPUs and GPUs</b>
                        
                        which are projects that I'd actally be interested in.

                        <br/><br/>

                        FFR takes alot of things from other Architectures that I like,
                        like <b style="color: coral">Alpha</b> and <b style="color: lightseagreen">Itanium</b>.
                        Like a Predicate for each instruction (taken from Itanium), 
                        aswell as the lack of a Flags register (taken from Alpha).
                        I've basically taken the things that in my opinion make for a good CPU Architecture,
                        I liked the 
                        
                        <b style="color: purple">Qualifying Predicate</b>
                        
                        from Itanium because it allows for any instruction to be
                        a Conditional instruction, making pipelining easier, as a small branch would no longer
                        have to cause a pipeline stall/reset.

                        I liked the lack of flags register because it makes Multi CPU/Multi-core implementations easier, 
                        as they won't have to rely on a shared flags register, reducing the amount that the flags register
                        is used. (Also it will make implementation in verilog easier, as it's 1 less register I have to worry about)

                    <h2>Instruction Formatting</h2>

                    <p>
                        FFR Instructions are all 64-bit (8 bytes) in size. The base Instruction Encoding common for all instructions,
                        is a 6-bit Predicate, and a 8-bit opcode. The Predicate is used for conditional instructions, every Instruction
                        can be executed conditionally, the 6-bit Predicate is an Index into the General Register File.
                        If let's say there is a: 
                        
                        <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
                        
                        <code>
                            <span style="color: greenyellow">cmpeq</span> 
                            <span style="color: coral"> r12</span>,
                            <span style="color: coral"> r13</span> = 
                            <span style="color: coral">r8</span>
                        </code>

                        <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
                        
                        (Compare equality between r12 and r13, and put the result into r8)

                        <br/><br/>

                        And afterwards there is a: 

                        <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
                        
                        <code>
                            <span style="color: blueviolet"> (8)</span>
                            <span style="color: greenyellow">mul</span> 
                            <span style="color: coral"> r31</span>, 
                            <span style="color: coral">r32</span> =
                            <span style="color: coral">r33</span>
                        </code>

                        <br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
                        
                        (Multiply r31 by r32 and store result in r33)

                        <br/><br/>

                        The multiply instruction will only execute if General Register 8 is equal to or above 1.
